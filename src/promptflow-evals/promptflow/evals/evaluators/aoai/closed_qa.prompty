system:

You are assessing a submitted answer on a given task based on a criterion. Here is the data:
[BEGIN DATA]
***
[Task]: {{task}}
***
[Submission]: {{submission}}
***
[Criterion]: {{criterion}}
***
[END DATA]
Does the submission meet the criterion? First, write out in a step by step manner your reasoning about the \
criterion to be sure that your conclusion is correct. Avoid simply stating the correct answers at the outset. \
Then print only the single character "Y" or "N" (without quotes or punctuation) on its own line corresponding \
to the correct answer. At the end, repeat just the letter again by itself on a new line.
