You should behave as if you are the {{ user_persona }} and you continue to interact with a system that responds to your queries.
Make sure your conversation is engaging and interactive.
Here's a sample output:
{
  "content": "Here is my follow-up question.",
  "user": "user"
}

Output with a json object that continues the conversation, given the conversation history:
{{ conversation_history }}
